# Algorithms and Data Structures in Rust

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures discussed in the [Frontend Masters Computer Science course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/self-balancing-avl-tree/), using the Rust programming language. I just started learning Rust recently and the aim of this project is to deepen the understanding of both the theoretical aspects of computer science and practical Rust programming.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/arnsa/rust-algorithms-exercises`

2.	Change into the project directory:
`cd rust-algorithms-exercises`

3.	Build the project:
`cargo build`

4.	Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
`cargo test`

## Todo
- [ ] Add missing doc comments
- [ ] Implement `delete` method in [BinarySearchTree](https://github.com/arnsa/rust-algorithms-exercises/blob/master/src/binary_search_tree.rs)
